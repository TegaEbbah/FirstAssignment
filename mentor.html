                I chose Tim Cook as my mentor because I think that our values line up. First, we both are very
                interested in technology.
                We both also want to stop climate change and have a greener future. Additionally, we believe in
                directness. Lastly, we share the
                value of generosity. As my role model, Tim Cook inspires me to develop great organizational skills,
                commitment to work, and capacity
                to work long hours. Cook is also well respected and liked by his colleagues, and I hope I can be
                similarly respected. If I could be only
                half as successful as Tim Cook has been in his work life, I would be very happy. Finally, Tim Cook dares
                to stand up for the rights he
                believes in, and I hope to do the same someday.

        </center>

            <p>
                Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960)[1] is an American business executive who has been the chief
                executive officer of Apple
                Inc. since 2011. Cook previously served as the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder
                Steve Jobs.[2] He is the first CEO
                of any Fortune 500 company who is openly gay.[3] Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice
                president for worldwide operations, and then
                served as the executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations.[4] He was made the chief
                executive on August 24, 2011, prior to Jobs'
                death in October of that year.[5] During his tenure as the chief executive, he has advocated for the
                political reformation of international and
                domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011
                when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook
                doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to
                $1.9 trillion.[6] In 2014, Cook became
                the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.[7] Cook also serves on
                the boards of directors of Nike, Inc.[5]
                and the National Football Foundation;[8] he is a trustee of Duke University, his alma mater.[9] Outside
                of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy,
                and in March 2015, he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.[10]
